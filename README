For this lab, you should write a tiny C program, called "Sum.c",
that prints the sum of 2 numbers to stdout and then indicates success by
exiting with a status of zero.

To test your work: 
linux> make clean; make; ./Sum

To run the same autograder that Autolab will use when you submit:
linux> ./driver.sh

Files:
README          This file
Makefile        Compiles Sum.c
driver.sh       Autolab autograder
Sum.c           Empty C file that you will edit
